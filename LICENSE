This is your playground. Seriously.

1. Do whatever you want with this code. Copy it, change it, break it, sell it, or turn it into a spaceship control system. All good.
2. You don’t have to credit me, but if you do, it’s cool.
3. I take no responsibility if things go kaboom. Use at your own risk.
4. Enjoy it, experiment, learn, and share it.
5. If you have fun, that’s all the thanks I need. No emails, no legal threats, just code
